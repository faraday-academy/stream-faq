# Stream FAQ

FAQs from Twitch and YouTube livestreams.

## Should I Learn Vue, React, or Some Other Framework?

It depends on your goals and experience. I recommend Vue as it's very robust and also the easiest (of all the major frameworks) to get started with. You can choose any framework though, as long as it is still under active development and has a large enough community to help you out if you get stuck.

## How Should I Start Learning How to Code?

I recommend freeCodeCamp.org. You can start learning Python and JavaScript right from your browser with interactive challenges.

## Why Don't You Use Typescript?

There is nothing wrong with Typescript, but there are complexity and speed tradeoffs with using it. I choose to use regular JS with linting rules and testing unless my team prefers Typescript.

## What VS Code theme do I use?

Dark theme: I usually use **Palenight**, right now I'm trying out **Seti Monokai**

Light theme: **Solarized light**
